  abstract = {With aging populations worldwide, there is growing interest in links between cognitive decline and elevated mortality risk\textemdash and, by extension, analytic approaches to further clarify these associations. Toward this end, some researchers have compared cognitive trajectories of survivors vs. decedents while others have examined longitudinal changes in cognition as predictive of mortality risk. A two-stage modeling framework is typically used in this latter approach; however, several recent studies have used joint longitudinal-survival modeling (i.e., estimating longitudinal change in cognition conditionally on mortality risk, and vice versa). Methodological differences inherent to these approaches may influence estimates of cognitive decline and cognition-mortality associations. These effects may vary across cognitive domains insofar as changes in broad fluid and crystallized abilities are differentially sensitive to aging and mortality risk. We compared these analytic approaches as applied to data from a large-sample, repeated-measures study of older adults (N = 5,954; ages 50\textendash 87 years at assessment; 4,453 deceased at last census). Cognitive trajectories indicated worse performance in decedents and when estimated jointly with mortality risk, but this was attenuated after adjustment for health-related covariates. Better cognitive performance predicted lower mortality risk, and, importantly, cognition-mortality associations were more pronounced when estimated in joint models. Associations between mortality risk and crystallized abilities only emerged under joint estimation. This may have important implications for cognitive reserve, which posits that knowledge and skills considered well-preserved in later life (i.e., crystallized abilities) may compensate for declines in abilities more prone to neurodegeneration, such as recall memory and problem solving. Joint longitudinal-survival models thus appear to be important (and currently underutilized) for research in cognitive epidemiology.},

Within this context our developments are motivated from a Dutch study at the Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Department of the Erasmus Medical Center, consisting of patients who received a human tissue valve in aortic position and who were thereafter monitored echocardiographically. Our aim is to utilize the available follow-up measurements of the current patients to produce dynamically updated predictions of both survival and freedom from re-intervention for future patients. In this paper, we propose to jointly model multiple longitudinal measurements combined with competing risk survival outcomes and derive the dynamically updated cumulative incidence functions. Moreover, we investigate whether different features of the longitudinal processes would change significantly the prediction for the events of interest by considering different types of association structures, such as time-dependent trajectory slopes and time-dependent cumulative effects. Our final contribution focuses on optimizing the quality of the derived predictions. In particular, instead of choosing one final model over a list of candidate models which ignores model uncertainty, we propose to suitably combine predictions from all considered models using Bayesian model averaging.},

  abstract = {AbstractAortic gradient and aortic regurgitation are echocardiographic markers of aortic valve function. Both are biomarkers repeatedly measured in patients with valve abnormalities, and thus, it is expected that they are biologically interrelated. Loss of follow-up could be caused by multiple reasons, including valve progression related, such as an intervention or even the death of the patient. In that case, it would be of interest and appropriate to analyze these outcomes jointly. Joint models have recently received much attention because they cover a wide range of clinical applications and have promising results. We propose a joint model consisting of two longitudinal outcomes, one continuous (aortic gradient) and one ordinal (aortic regurgitation), and two time-to-events (death and reoperation). Moreover, we allow for more flexibility for the average evolution and the subject-specific profiles of the continuous repeated outcome by using B-splines. A disadvantage, however, is that when adopting a non-linear structure for the model, we may have difficulties when interpreting the results. To overcome this problem, we propose a graphical approach. In this paper, we apply the proposed joint models under the Bayesian framework, using a data set including serial echocardiographic measurements of aortic gradient and aortic regurgitation and measurements of the occurrence of death and reoperation in patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. The interpretation of the results will be discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is being used increasingly to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); however, its impact on immune reconstitution is relatively unknown. We (i) studied immune reconstitution after ATGconditioned hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), (ii) determined the factors influencing the reconstitution, and (iii) compared it with non-ATG-conditioned HCT. Methods. Immune cell subset counts were determined at 1\textendash 24 months posttransplant in 125 HCT recipients who received ATG during conditioning. Subset counts were also determined in 46 nonATG-conditioned patients (similarly treated). Results. (i) Reconstitution after ATG-conditioned HCT was fast for innate immune cells, intermediate for B cells and CD8 T cells, and very slow for CD4 T cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) (iNKT) cells. (ii) Faster reconstitution after ATG-conditioned HCT was associated with a higher number of cells of the same subset transferred with the graft in the case of memory B cells, naive CD4 T cells, naive CD8 T cells, iNKT cells and myeloid dendritic cells; lower recipient age in the case of naive CD4 T cells and naive CD8 T cells; cytomegalovirus recipient seropositivity in the case of memory/effector T cells; an absence of GvHD in the case of naive B cells; lower ATG serum levels in the case of most T-cell subsets, including iNKT cells; and higher ATG levels in the case of NK cells and B cells. (iii) Compared with non-ATG-conditioned HCT, reconstitution after ATG-conditioned HCT was slower for CD4 T cells, and faster for NK cells and B cells. Conclusions. ATG worsens the reconstitution of CD4 T cells but improves the reconstitution of NK and B cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical prediction models (CPMs) predict the risk of health outcomes for individual patients. The majority of existing CPMs only harness cross-sectional patient information. Incorporating repeated measurements, such as those stored in electronic health records, into CPMs may provide an opportunity to enhance their performance. However, the number and complexity of methodological approaches available could make it difficult for researchers to explore this opportunity. Our objective was to review the literature and summarise existing approaches for harnessing repeated measurements of predictor variables in CPMs, primarily to make this field more accessible for applied researchers. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles reporting the development of a multivariable CPM for individual-level prediction of future binary or time-to-event outcomes and modelling repeated measurements of at least one predictor. Information was extracted on the following: the methodology used, its specific aim, reported advantages and limitations, and software available to apply the method. Results: The search revealed 217 relevant articles. Seven methodological frameworks were identified: time-dependent covariate modelling, generalised estimating equations, landmark analysis, two-stage modelling, joint-modelling, trajectory classification and machine learning. Each of these frameworks satisfies at least one of three aims: to better represent the predictor-outcome relationship over time, to infer a covariate value at a pre-specified time and to account for the effect of covariate change. Conclusions: The applicability of identified methods depends on the motivation for including longitudinal information and the method's compatibility with the clinical context and available patient data, for both model development and risk estimation in practice.},

The occurrence of morbidity and mortality after allo-HCT is still high. This is partly correlated with the immunological recovery of the T cell subsets, of which the dynamics and relations to complications are still poorly understood. Detailed information on T cell subset recovery is crucial to provide tools for better prediction and modulation of adverse events. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, iNKT cells, Treg cells, MAIT cells and naive and memory T cell reconstitution, as well as their relations to outcome, considering different cell sources and immunosuppressive therapies. We conclude that the T cell subsets reconstitute in different ways and are associated with distinct adverse and beneficial events; however, adequate reconstitution of all the subsets is associated with better overall survival. Although the exact mechanisms involved in the reconstitution of each T cell subset and their associations with allo-HCT outcome need to be further elucidated, the data and suggestions presented here point towards the development of individualized approaches to improve their reconstitution. This includes the modulation of immunotherapeutic interventions based on more detailed immune monitoring, aiming to improve overall survival changes.},

  abstract = {After the diagnosis of a disease, one major objective is to predict cumulative probabilities of events such as clinical relapse or death from the individual information collected up to a prediction time, usually including biomarker repeated measurements. Several competing estimators have been proposed, mainly from two approaches: joint modelling and landmarking. These approaches differ by the information used, the model assumptions and the complexity of the computational procedures. This paper aims to review the two approaches, precisely define the derived estimators of dynamic predictions and compare their performances notably in case of misspecification. The ultimate goal is to provide key elements for the use of individual dynamic predictions in clinical practice. Prediction of two competing causes of prostate cancer progression from the history of prostate-specific antigen is used as a motivated example. We formally define the quantity to estimate and its estimators, propose techniques to assess the uncertainty around predictions and validate them. We then conduct an in-depth simulation study compare the estimators in terms of prediction error, discriminatory power, efficiency and robustness to model assumptions. We show that prediction tools should be handled with care, in particular by properly specifying models and estimators.},

  abstract = {Joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data is increasingly used in clinical trials on cancer. In prostate cancer for example, these models permit to account for the link between longitudinal measures of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and time of clinical recurrence when studying the risk of relapse. In practice, multiple types of relapse may occur successively. Distinguishing these transitions between health states would allow to evaluate, for example, how PSA trajectory and classical covariates impact the risk of dying after a distant recurrence post-radiotherapy, or to predict the risk of one specific type of clinical recurrence post-radiotherapy, from the PSA history. In this context, we present a joint model for a longitudinal process and a multi-state process which is divided into two sub-models: a linear mixed sub-model for longitudinal data, and a multi-state sub-model with proportional hazards for transition times, both linked by a function of shared random effects. Parameters of this joint multi-state model are estimated within the maximum likelihood framework using an EM algorithm coupled with a quasi-Newton algorithm in case of slow convergence. It is implemented under R, by combining and extending mstate and JM packages. The estimation program is validated by simulations and applied on pooled data from two cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer. Thanks to the classical covariates available at baseline and the repeated PSA measurements, we are able to assess the biomarker's trajectory, define the risks of transitions between health states, and quantify the impact of the PSA dynamics on each transition intensity.},

Despite the recent methodological developments, there are still limited options for fitting these models in standard statistical software programs, which prohibits their adoption by applied biostatisticians. We summarize four published models, each of which has software available for model estimation. Each model features a different hazard function, latent association structure between the submodels, estimation approach and software implementation. Of the four models considered here, the model specifications and association structures are substantially different, thus complicating model-to-model comparison. The models are applied to the `Standard and new anti-epileptic drugs' trial of anti-epileptic drugs to investigate the effect of drug titration on the treatment effects of lamotrigine and carbamazepine on the mode of treatment failure. Notwithstanding the vastly different association structures, we show that the inference from each model is consistent, namely, that there is a beneficial effect of lamotrigine on unacceptable adverse events over carbamazepine and a non-significant effect on the hazard of inadequate seizure control. The association between anti-epileptic drug titration and treatment failure was significant in most models. To allow for the routine adoption of joint modelling of competing risks and longitudinal data in the analysis of clinical data sets, further work is required on the development of model diagnostics to aid model choice.},

To illustrate the methods a covariate was included. Simulation was used to assess the effect of the assumptions. Results Ignoring attrition or restricting analysis to participants with complete follow up led to biased estimates. Linear mixed model was appropriate for an immortal cohort under MAR but not MNAR. Linear increment model and joint modeling of longitudinal outcome and time to death were the most robust to MNAR. For a mortal cohort, inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation could be used, but care is needed in specifying dropout and imputation models, respectively.

  abstract = {Both dropout and death can truncate observation of a longitudinal outcome. Since extrapolation beyond death is often not appropriate, it is desirable to obtain the longitudinal outcome profile of a population given being alive. We propose a new likelihood-based approach to accommodating informative dropout and death by jointly modelling the longitudinal outcome and semicompeting event times of dropout and death, with an important feature that the conditional longitudinal profile of being alive can be conveniently obtained in a closed form. We use proposed methods to estimate different longitudinal profiles of CD4 cell count for patients from the `HIV Epidemiology Research Study'.},

  abstract = {Failure to account for time-dependent treatment use when developing a prognostic model can result in biased future predictions. We reviewed currently available methods to account for treatment use when developing a prognostic model. First, we defined the estimands targeted by each method and examined their mechanisms of action with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Next, methods were implemented in data from 1,906 patients; 325 received selective {$\beta$}-blockers (SBBs) during follow-up. We demonstrated seven Cox regression modeling strategies: (a) ignoring SBB treatment; (b) excluding SBB users or (c) censoring them when treated; (d) inverse probability of treatment weighting after censoring (IPCW), including SBB treatment as (e) a binary or (f) a time-dependent covariate; and (g) marginal structural modeling (MSM). Using DAGs, we demonstrated IPCW and MSM have the best properties and target a similar estimand. In the case study, compared to (a), approaches (b) and (e) provided predictions that were 1\% and 2\% higher on average. Performance (c-statistic, Brier score, calibration slope) varied minimally between approaches. Our review of methods confirmed that ignoring treatment is theoretically inferior, but differences between the prediction models obtained using different methods can be modest in practice. Future simulation studies and applications are needed to assess the value of applying IPCW or MSM to adjust for treatments in different treatment and disease settings.},

  abstract = {Often, in follow-up studies, patients experience intermediate events, such as reinterventions or adverse events, which directly affect the shapes of their longitudinal profiles. Our work is motivated by two studies in which such intermediate events have been recorded during follow-up. In both studies, we are interested in the change of the longitudinal evolutions after the occurrence of the intermediate event and in utilizing this information to improve the accuracy of dynamic prediction of their risk. To achieve so, we propose a flexible joint modeling framework for longitudinal and time-to-event data, which includes features of the intermediate event as time-varying covariates in both the longitudinal and survival submodels. We consider a set of joint models that postulate different effects of the intermediate event in the longitudinal profile and the risk of the clinical endpoint, with different formulations for the association structure while allowing its functional form to change after the occurrence of the intermediate event. Based on these models, we derive dynamic predictions of conditional survival probabilities which are adaptive to different scenarios with respect to the occurrence of the intermediate event. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of these predictions with a simulation study using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the expected prediction error adjusted to our setting. The results suggest that accounting for the changes in the longitudinal profiles and the instantaneous risk for the clinical endpoint is important, and improves the accuracy of the dynamic predictions.},

  abstract = {Background aims: To reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), T-cell depletion (TCD) of grafts can be performed by the addition of alemtuzumab (ALT) ``to the bag'' (in vitro) before transplantation. In this prospective study, the authors analyzed the effect of in vitro incubation with 20 mg ALT on the composition of grafts prior to graft infusion. Furthermore, the authors assessed whether graft composition at the moment of infusion was predictive for T-cell reconstitution and development of GVHD early after TCD alloSCT. Methods: Sixty granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized stem cell grafts were obtained from  9/10 HLA-matched related and unrelated donors. The composition of the grafts was analyzed by flow cytometry before and after in vitro incubation with ALT. T-cell reconstitution and incidence of severe GVHD were monitored until 12 weeks after transplantation. Results: In vitro incubation of grafts with 20 mg ALT resulted in an initial median depletion efficiency of T-cell receptor (TCR) a/b T cells of 96.7\% (range, 63.5\`A99.8\%), followed by subsequent depletion in vivo. Graft volumes and absolute leukocyte counts of grafts before the addition of ALT were not predictive for the efficiency of TCR a/b T-cell depletion. CD4pos T cells were depleted more efficiently than CD8pos T cells, and naive and regulatory T cells were depleted more efficiently than memory and effector T cells. This differential depletion of T-cell subsets was in line with their reported differential CD52 expression. In vitro depletion efficiencies and absolute numbers of (naive) TCR a/b T cells in the grafts after ALT incubation were not predictive for Tcell reconstitution or development of GVHD post- alloSCT. Conclusions: The addition of ALT to the bag is an easy, fast and generally applicable strategy to prevent GVHD in patients receiving alloSCT after myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning because of the efficient differential depletion of donor-derived lymphocytes and T cells.},

Such heterogeneity could be attributable to the cognitive functions studied and study population characteristics, but also to differential selection by dropout and death between men and women. We aimed to evaluate the impact of selection by dropout and death on the association between sex/gender and cognitive decline. We first compared the statistical methods most frequently used for longitudinal data, targeting either population estimands (marginal models fitted by generalized estimating equations) or subject-specific estimands (mixed/joint models fitted by likelihood maximization) in 8 studies of aging: 6 population-based studies (the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study (1996\textendash 2009), Personnes \^Ag\'ees QUID (PAQUID; 1988\textendash 2014), the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study (2003\textendash 2016), the Three-City Study (Bordeaux only; 1999\textendash 2016), the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP; 1992\textendash 2017), and the Whitehall II Study (2007\textendash 2016)) and 2 clinic-based studies (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; 2004\textendash 2017) and a nationwide French cohort study, MEMENTO (2011\textendash 2016)). We illustrate differences in the estimands of the association between sex/gender and cognitive decline in selected examples and highlight the critical role of differential selection by dropout and death. Using the same estimand, we then contrast the sex/gender\textendash cognitive decline associations across cohorts and cognitive measures suggesting a residual differential sex/gender association depending on the targeted cognitive measure (memory or animal fluency) and the initial cohort selection. We recommend focusing on subject-specific estimands in the living population for assessing sex/gender differences while handling differential selection over time.},

The interpretation of ML estimates of mixed models and joint models for the marker and the time-to-death as well as unweighted and weighted GEE of marginal models is then illustrated in a simulation study and in an application regarding cognitive decline in the elderly.},

The association between severity markers and the events death or alive discharge has been acknowledged before, however, little is known about the addition of PVAs data to the analyses. We used an index of asynchronies (AI) to measure PVAs and the SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score to assess overall severity. To investigate the added value of including the AI, we propose a Bayesian joint model of bivariate longitudinal and competing risks data. The longitudinal process includes a mixed effects model for the SOFA score and a mixed effects beta regression model for the AI. The survival process is defined in terms of a cause-specific hazards model for the competing risks death or alive discharge. Our model indicates that the SOFA score is strongly related to vital status. PVAs are positively associated with alive discharge but there is not enough evidence that PVAs provide a more accurate indication of death prognosis than the SOFA score alone.},

The optimization of graft composition should not only enable a sufficient IR but also improve graft vs. leukemia/tumor effects, overcome infectious complications and, finally, improve patient survival. Especially in haploidentical SCT, the optimization of graft composition is controversial. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of graft manipulation on IR in 40 patients with acute leukemia in remission. We examined the cell recovery post haploidentical SCT in patients receiving a CD34+-selected or CD3/CD19-depleted graft, considering the applied conditioning regimen. We used joint model analysis for overall survival (OS) and analyzed the dynamics of age-adjusted leukocytes; lymphocytes; monocytes; CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ T cells; natural killer (NK) cells; and B cells over the course of time after SCT. Lymphocytes, NK cells, and B cells expanded more rapidly after SCT with CD34+-selected grafts (P = 0.036, P = 0.002, and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Contrarily, CD3+CD4+ helper T cells recovered delayer in the CD34 selected group (P = 0.026). Furthermore, reduced intensity conditioning facilitated faster immune recovery of lymphocytes and T cells and their subsets (P {$<$} 0.001). However, the immune recovery for NK cells and B cells was comparable for patients who received reducedintensity or full preparative regimens. Dynamics of all cell types had a significant influence on OS, which did not differ between patients receiving CD34+-selected and those receiving CD3/CD19-depleted grafts. In conclusion, cell reconstitution dynamics showed complex diversity with regard to the graft manufacturing procedure and conditioning regimen.},

Such predictions are of interest in oncology where after an initial treatment, patients are monitored with repeated biomarker data. However, in such setting, patients may receive second treatments to slow down the progression of the disease. This paper aims to develop and validate dynamic individual predictions that allow the possibility of a new treatment in order to help understand the benefit of initiating new treatments during the monitoring period. The prediction of the event in the next x years is done under two scenarios: (1) the patient initiates immediately a second treatment, (2) the patient does not initiate any treatment in the next x years. Predictions are derived from shared random-effect models. Applied to prostate cancer data, different specifications for the dependence between the prostate-specific antigen repeated measures, the initiation of a second treatment (hormonal therapy), and the risk of clinical recurrence are investigated and compared. The predictive accuracy of the dynamic predictions is evaluated with two measures (Brier score and prognostic cross-entropy) for which approximated cross-validated estimators are proposed.},

  abstract = {Donor chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is commonly used to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Because chimerism is observed at 1 or more times after allo-SCT and not at baseline, if chimerism is in fact associated with OS or DFS, then the occurrence of either disease progression or death informatively censors (terminates) the observed chimerism process. This violates the assumptions underlying standard statistical regression methods for survival analysis, which may lead to biased conclusions. To assess the association between the longitudinal posteallo-SCT donor chimerism process and OS or DFS, we analyzed data from 195 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 157) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 38) who achieved complete remission after allo-SCT following a reducedtoxicity conditioning regimen of fludarabine/intravenous busulfan. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 1.1 to 105 months). Fitted joint longitudinal-survival time models showed that a binary indicator of complete (100\%) donor chimerism and increasing percent of donor T cells were significantly associated with longer OS, whereas decreasing percent of donor T cells was highly significantly associated with shorter OS. Our analyses illustrate the usefulness of modeling repeated posteallo-SCT chimerism measurements as individual longitudinal processes jointly with OS and DFS to estimate their relationships.},

Refining the predictive value of post-treatment PSA determinations may add to clinical management, and we have developed a model that predicts future PSA values and the time to future clinical recurrence for individual patients. Patients and Methods Data from 934 patients treated between 1987 and 2000 were used to develop a comprehensive statistical model to fit the clinical recurrence events and patterns of PSA data. A logistic model was used for the probability of cure, mixed models were used for serial PSA measurements, and a proportional hazards model was used for recurrences. Data available through February 2001 were fit to the model, and data collected between February 2001 and September 2003 were used for validation. Results T-stage, baseline PSA, and radiotherapy dosage are all associated with probability of cure. The risk of clinical recurrence in those not cured is strongly affected by the slope of PSA values. We show how the model can be used for individual monitoring of disease progression. For each patient the model predicts, based on baseline characteristics and all post-treatment PSA values, the probability of future clinical recurrences and future PSA values. The model accurately predicts risk of recurrence and future PSA values in the validation data set. Conclusion This predictive information on future PSA values and the risk of clinical relapse for each individual patient, which can be updated with each additional PSA value, may prove useful to patients and physicians in determining post-treatment salvage strategies.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal experiments often involve multiple outcomes measured repeatedly within a set of study participants. While many questions can be answered by modeling the various outcomes separately, some questions can only be answered in a joint analysis of all of them. In this article, we will present a review of the many approaches proposed in the statistical literature. Four main model families will be presented, discussed and compared. Focus will be on presenting advantages and disadvantages of the different models rather than on the mathematical or computational details.},

  abstract = {For longitudinal data where the response and time-dependent predictors within each individual are measured at distinct time points, traditional longitudinal models such as generalized linear mixed effects models or marginal models cannot be directly applied. Instead, some preprocessing such as smoothing is required to temporally align the response and predictors. We propose a binning method, which results in equally spaced bins of time. After incorporating binning, traditional models can be applied. The proposed binning approach was applied on a longitudinal hemodialysis study to look for possible contemporaneous and lagged effects between occurrences of a health event (i.e. infection) and levels of a protein marker of inflammation (i.e. C-reactive protein). Both Poisson mixed effects models and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) mixed effects models were applied to the subsequent data, and some important biological findings about contemporaneous and lagged associations were uncovered. In addition, a simulation study was conducted to investigate various properties of the binning approach. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Data with multivariate count responses frequently occur in modern applications. The commonly used multinomial-logit model is limiting due to its restrictive mean-variance structure. For instance, analyzing count data from the recent RNA-seq technology by the multinomial-logit model leads to serious errors in hypothesis testing. The ubiquity of overdispersion and complicated correlation structures among multivariate counts calls for more flexible regression models. In this article, we study some generalized linear models that incorporate various correlation structures among the counts. Current literature lacks a treatment of these models, partly because they do not belong to the natural exponential family. We study the estimation, testing, and variable selection for these models in a unifying framework. The regression models are compared on both synthetic and real RNA-seq data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
