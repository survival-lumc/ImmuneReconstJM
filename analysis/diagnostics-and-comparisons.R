# To-do here:
# - Comparison of marginal and subj specific trajetories JM vs mixed mod
# - Comparison of JM estimates vs time-dep Cox
# - Plotting of marginal cumulative hazards
# - Residuals plotting (marg and subj spec, see book)
# - Checking overall convergence and Hessian positive definiteness
# - Fitting with both lme and lmer (latter give singular fit quicker)
# - Lmer-based repca for justifying random effects
#   VarCorr() and summary(rePCA(...))
# - Maximum likelihood anovas() for value vs value + slope, maybs also
#   for the longitudinal models themselves
